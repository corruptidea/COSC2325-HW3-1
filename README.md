# COSC2325-HW3-1

Write a program with a loop and indexed addressing that calculates the sum of all the gaps between
successive array elements. The array elements are doublewords, sequenced in nondecreasing order.
So, for example, the array 0, 2, 5, 9, 10 has gaps of 2, 3, 4, and 1, whose sum equals 10.
